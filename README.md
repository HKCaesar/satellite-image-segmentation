# satellite-image-segmentation
This was my final project at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp. It was done as part of a partnership with Digital Globe, utilizing images from their WorldView-3 satellite to perform image segmentation.

## Project Goal

In my project, I performed image segmentation on satellite imagery from Shanghai in an attempt to map out the location of farmland. In the course of the project, I was able to extend to segmenting multiple classes, but for the purposes of the presentation, my focus was on farmland.

![Shanghai Farmland](/images/farmland1.png =256x "Shanghai Farmland")
![Shanghai Farmland](/images/farmland2.png =256x "Shanghai Farmland")
![Shanghai Farmland](/images/farmland3.png =256x "Shanghai Farmland")
